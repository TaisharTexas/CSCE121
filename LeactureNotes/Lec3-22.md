## UML Diagrams and Vectors

class is a generic description or a blueprint
object is an instance of the class or blueprint

if the class describes what a house is, the object is the actual house and its a little different from other house objects

class members:
- public members (things that can accessed from the outside -- typically methods or data members)
- private members (hidden from the outside, generally for internal functionality -- typically helper functions and data members)

use accessor and mutator methods to access data members inside a class without making the variables public (we control who and how data is accessed from the class)
ie, int getHeight(){ return height; }
ie, void setHeight(int h){ height = h; }

both of the above methods are built to access height inside the class even though height is private.

variables that only get set one time, are set in the constructor

Implied attributes look like set data members from the outside, but are actually calculated each time the getter-function is called


Use UML Diagrams to model a class or group of classes to get an idea of what's needed.

Vector class

basically a smart array
resizes itself
