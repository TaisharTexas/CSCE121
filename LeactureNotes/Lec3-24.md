## Classes

User defined data types (can be more complex than just standard data types)

class className{

    className(argument, argument){
        argument = value;
        argument = value;
    }

    visibility:
        variable;
        variable;
        ...

        function(){};
        function(){};
        ...
}

private - default, can only be accessed from within the class
public - can be accessed outside of the class, commonly used for user-facing functions, default for structs

"this->" refers to the version that belongs to the class and not the function version
