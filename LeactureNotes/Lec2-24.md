##Arrays

- array of capacity m is allocated m contiguous blocks of memory in the call stack
- If initialized, the memory blocks have values, otherwise garbage values are used
- the index is literally the address of the element in the array.

- when declaring and initializing cstrings, make sure to include the null character, '\0'
