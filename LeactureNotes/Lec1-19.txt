Every c++ program has a main function. Without a main function, the program can't start.

#include <iostream>
  inserts the code from the iostream library into the current file (like an import statement)

int main(){}
  main always returns an int

iostream gives access to cout and endl and cin




  initializes cout to output to the console -- says to use the cout from the namespace std
  will need to point to std every time cout is used

using std::cout, std::endl, std::cin;
  done once and now cout and endl and cin can be used without point to std every time.

return 0;
  indicates if the program finished or not. Not required for main.

cout << "bool: " << boolaplha << true;
  boolaplha tells cout to print "true" or "false" instead of 0 or nonzero
