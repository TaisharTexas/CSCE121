## Arrays

### Aggregate Data Type
- aggregate data types: can represent a collection of different data types
- can store both built in and other aggregate data types.

Heterogenous Aggregate: like a class or a struct, not all the elements are of the same type -- string with an int length and string body
Homogenous Aggregate: like arrays or vectors, all the elements inside are the same -- an array of ints
Pseudo-Heterogenous Aggregate:

- Strings are Heterogenous aggregates
- arrays are Homogenous aggregates

#### Parallel Arrays
allows you to link two arrays of different types.
If one array is the name of a some things, and the second array are the values for the names, you can link the arrays using parallel arrays
can built a program where the series of arrays are only used as a group -- like name, price, calories, and beef content of several meals.

#### Arrays
Arrays are declared at exactly the size specified and cannot be changed after compilation
The array's size is the number of slots currently in use.
The array's capacity is the total number of slots the array was initialized with.

#### Stack Memory
a reserved space in memory for local variables
local variables: variables declared inside functions
int nums[3] = {} -- sets all the values in nums to 0
int nums[4] = {3} -- sets the first value to 3 and all the remaining values to the default value, which is 0 for int
