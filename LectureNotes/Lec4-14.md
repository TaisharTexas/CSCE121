## Rule of Three

shallow copy: n1 = n1; -- if you change n1, then you change n2 because the memory points to the same location

deep copy: the values are copied over but the memory locations are separate

classes have three member functions (always)
- Destructor
- Copy Constructor
- Copy Assignment Operator
