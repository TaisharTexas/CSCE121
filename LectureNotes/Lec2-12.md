### I/O Streams and Formatting

I/O means input/output

I/O allows for sending or receiving an unknown number of characters.
cin and cout are console i/o streams


### Buffer

A generic term for a block of memory that serves as a temporary placeholder.
Writing to the buffer is much faster than direct access to memory

endl; -- inserts a new line in the buffer and flushes the buffer (use \n when you won't want to flush)
flush; -- flushes the output buffers
.

cerr: where standard error messages are sent. Not buffered. Output happens immediately as opposed to cout which does use the buffer.

#### Output Steam
cout is part of output stream
via #include <iostream>

ostream provides the insertion operator (<<)
cout is a type of ostream.

ostream turns values of various types into character sequences via the insertion operator (sequences are placed in the buffer and then sent out to wherever they need (the screen, a file, etc))

#### Input Stream
it's basically the input version of ostream
accessed via iostream same as ostream

characters from somewhere (ie the keyboard) are put in the buffer, then sent to istream and turned into different types of data (ie, string, int, double) and written to variables

#### Int Formatting

lets you output ints in decimal, octal (abse 8), and hexadecmial (base 16)
gotten via <iostream>

#### Floating Pt Manipulators
setprecision() truncates the value next in line to the specified number ( cout << setprecision(5) << miles << "mph, p=5" << endl;) -- outputs 5 digits
fixed -- uses the last known value of setprecision() and applies setprecision to variables being outputted.
requires #include <iomanip>


#### Text alignment Manipulators
helps align Text
setw(int), setfill(char), right, left
using std::left, std::right, std::setw, std::setfill;
