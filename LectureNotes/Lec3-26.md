## classes again

class Date{
		int month;
		int day;

public:
		everything else
}

the constructor can give values to variables instantiated by a class

## operator overloading
adding ints is normal
adding strings with "+" is an overloading of the plus operator to concatenate strings

// overloading the "out" operator so that it can also print out a custom scuct
ostream& operator << (ostream& out, const Pixel &pixel){
		out << "(";
		out << pixel.r << ", " << pixel.g << ", " << pixel.b << ")";
}
main(){
		Pixel maroon = {12, 2, 3}
		//normally can't use cout to print a struct, but it can with the custom overloaded operator
		cout << maroon << endl;
}

//overloading ostream to output data from a class
ostream& operator << (ostream& os, const MyClass& mc){
		os << mc.getData1() << " " << mc.getData2();
		return os;
}

friend lets you give something access to all private and protected objects in a class
