##Destructors and RAII

this pointer (->)
- an object's implicit pointer that point to its own memory location
- can be called implicitly or explicitly

- the accessor functions get the int data member with and without a this pointer
- only needed if there are two members with the same name but with different scopes
int Number::getValue1() { return value; }
int Number::getValue2() {return (*this).value; }

this-> syntax

- this->num = num;
modifies value of data members

- return this->num;
accesses value of data member

- cout << this->get() << endl;
calls member function
