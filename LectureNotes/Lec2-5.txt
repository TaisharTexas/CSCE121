Rubber Duck debugging:
explaining each line of the program to someone (or a rubber duck). Going through each line out loud will help you better see errors and typos.


check if an INT looks like a mountain (ie, increasing and then decreasing symmetrically --> 1 2  5 7 6 4 3 2)
- need to extract digits from an INT
- compare consecutive digits
- identify when the peak has been reached
- possible issues:
    no peak (always increasing or decreasing)
    how is it defined for less than 3 digits
 use number slicing
