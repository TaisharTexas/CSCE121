### String class

string is a user-defined data type in cpp. Unlike floats, doubles, chars, bools, and ints which are built-in data types in cpp.

A string stores each character in its value with a separate memory location.

#### Syntax

must declare
must instantiate
ie, string variableName = "text";

__________________________

string class has some built-in functions that string objects can call

use getline(cin, variableName) when collecting sentences to a string, otherwise use standard cin for one or two words.

#### String Comparison

string represents characters internally with ASCII numbers. String uses the ascii value of each character when doing string comparisons

exception.what() outputs a string that was constructed when the exception was thrown (assuming a throw() was triggered with an attached string)

variableName.at(index) returns the character at the index specified of the string
  .at() checks to make sure the requested index is a valid index (ie, within the length of the string)
  the [] operators also work, but they don't check if the index is valid.

variableName.find() can find a word, lack of a word, an article, or a letter

variableName.replace() and variableName.insert() used to insert characters into a string and used to override a set index range with new characters
